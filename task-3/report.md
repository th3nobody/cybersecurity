### 7. Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors.

- Even though phishing email seems real there are some mojor mistakes in that template.
  - first mistake is sender email, nowadays official email are verified but this email is nither verified nor seems legitimate.
  - All new emails from meta comes with meta signature but this email does not contains one.

   - Even though the UI was almost same but the link was way too off

     i.e

          https://largely-helpful-swift.global.ssl.fastly.net/NTQzYWNjMTAxMzkzM2MyYmM4MmE1YQ==/ig-en.php?profileid=780849966&amp;auth=OWZhMzQ1ZmExOGU3MGI4NzZjZGYzMA==
